# GPUComputing
Code for Optimising Matrix-Matrix Multiplication assignment for GPU, Many-Core and Cluster Computing as part of Contemporary Computer Science IV module, taken in my fourth year of Computer Science at Durham University.

# Level 3
The code for the level 3/4 part (section 2) is in the section2 folder.

# Level 4
The code for the level 4 only part (section 3) is in the section3 folder.

# Dataset
The assignment was accompanied by several tarballs of matrices of ranging sizes to use for testing the binaries. As these are not available publicly, you will have to create your own matrices in the correct format (COO) should you wish to test them other than through make check or ./binary CHECK.
